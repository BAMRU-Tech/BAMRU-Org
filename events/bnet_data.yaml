      snowfield/glacier and locate a crevasse system where we will set-up and run
      multiple crevasse rescue systems using various snow/ice anchors.  Day 3 has
      two tracks: a) practice ice axe self arrest and running belays if not signed
      off on these, or b) make a early AM summit attempt (led by Tom Lass).  Both
      groups will then descend, and drive back to the Bay area.  The weekend is open

    description: 'The pre-planning exercises are designed to help us gather data on
      a park or open space in regards to terrain, vegetation, hazards, high-probability
      areas, command post logistics, and communications challenges.  As with our previous
      efforts at Sam McDonald Park and Russian Ridge OSP, this exercise will focus
      on using the same protocols that we would use on an actual search:  teams will
      be formed, given assignments, briefed and dispatched.  When those teams return,
      they will be debriefed for information about their assigned area, and GPS tracks
      and waypoints will be downloaded. In addition to the benefits we receive from
      our exposure to the parks, we also meet with the rangers that work these areas
      and develop relationships that will pay dividends when we respond to search
      emergencies.  While I was meeting with the Supervising Ranger for Butano, a
      10 year old girl suffered a fall in the park and suffered a broken arm  radius
      and ulna fractures, with severe angulation.  She was only about a quarter of
      a mile from the campground, and the call was handled by CalFire and AMR with
      the Ranger and myself assisting.  But it was clear that if she had been much
      further away from the campground, it was exactly the kind of carryout that we
      would be engaged in.  '

      At 2245, December 31, 2012, BAMRU was paged to respond immediately as
      mutual aid to a missing person search in Marin County. The subject,
      Dennis Klein, was a 69 year old male who frequently hikes in the Mount
      Tamalpais area, believed to have several medical conditions. The
      subject had briefly made contact with 911 to report himself as missing
      and had given a brief description of his surroundings before his cell
      phone died. The subject was found having slid down into a ravine, and
      was evacuated with the help of members of several units. He was found
      alive and with only minor injuries. BAMRU had two members in the field
      and were flanking an area K9 on a hillside well above the find
      location when the search concluded, additionally, several members were
      assisting in the CP. All BAMRU members arrived home safe by the
      morning of New Year's Day.

      Members Only -\n\nInterviewing is an important part of search investigation
      and yet is often a hastily done and incomplete task. In many searches especially
      in an urban environment, an interview may be the largest generator of clues
      on where to search. This presentation/workshop will discuss why we need to interview
      and compare and contrast interview and interrogation in law enforcement and
      the unique requirements and needs in the Search and Rescue world. It will probe
      the \"how to\" mechanics of conducting a good interview from the setting for
      the interview, to the demeanor of the interviewer, to the type of in depth questions
      and how the information gathered can be used to paint a mental picture and profile
      of the missing subject. This information can then be used to assist the planning
      function in establishing where to look and the best use of SAR resources. The
      discussions will include initial and post search interviewing, as well as telephone
      and door-to-door interviewing. The workshop will also include interview practice
      exercises."

      Short version:<br>
      Learn and practice Purcell setup and usage prior to the Personal Rock Skills training weekend.
      <p>
      The details:<br>
      Purcell prusiks are awesome: incredibly valuable as part of your personal alpine skills repertoire and used constantly in technical rescue. They're also a bit tricky to set up and require some practice to use effectively. Come to this skills night in the wild alpine hinterlands of Daly City!<p>

      the past 4 years.  By performing this community service, we will be educating
      kids at the beginning of a week long event.  For many of these kids, it is the
      first time camping in a wilderness setting.  We equip the kids with some knowledge
      about how help themselves and us in the event they become lost in the wilderness.
      \ Consider it \"Preventative SAR\".\n \nWe typically show a 15 minute video,
      and have a short Q&A about what they learned.  Afterwards, we take the group
      outside and let the groups perform some little handling exercises where they
      get a feeling for what it's like to be involved in a rescue and that it's hard
      work; hopefully it makes it a bit fun, and perhaps they might remember some
      of the presentation.\n \nMembers are encouraged to attend and assist with the
      presentation and supervise the litter handling.  Having members in red shirts
      or SMCSO uniforms are appreciated.\n "

    description: Interviewing is an important part of search investigation and yet
      is often a hastily done and incomplete task. In many searches especially in
      an urban environment, an interview may be the largest generator of clues on
      where to search. This presentation/workshop will discuss why we need to interview
      and compare and contrast interview and interrogation in law enforcement and
      the unique requirements and needs in the Search and Rescue world. It will probe
      the "how to" mechanics of conducting a good interview from the setting for the
      interview, to the demeanor of the interviewer, to the type of in depth questions
      and how the information gathered can be used to paint a mental picture and profile
      of the missing subject. This information can then be used to assist the planning
      function in establishing where to look and the best use of SAR resources. The
      discussions will include initial and post search interviewing, as well as telephone
      and door-to-door interviewing. The workshop will also include interview practice
      exercises.
