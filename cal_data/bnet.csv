community,SMCSAR Preplan Exercise ,Ethan Frantz,2010-06-26,"","","",Butano State Park,,,"The pre-planning exercises are designed to help us gather data on a park or open space in regards to terrain, vegetation, hazards, high-probability areas, command post logistics, and communications challenges.  As with our previous efforts at Sam McDonald Park and Russian Ridge OSP, this exercise will focus on using the same protocols that we would use on an actual search:  teams will be formed, given assignments, briefed and dispatched.  When those teams return, they will be debriefed for information about their assigned area, and GPS tracks and waypoints will be downloaded. In addition to the benefits we receive from our exposure to the parks, we also meet with the rangers that work these areas and develop relationships that will pay dividends when we respond to search emergencies.  While I was meeting with the Supervising Ranger for Butano, a 10 year old girl suffered a fall in the park and suffered a broken arm  radius and ulna fractures, with severe angulation.  She was only about a quarter of a mile from the campground, and the call was handled by CalFire and AMR with the Ranger and myself assisting.  But it was clear that if she had been much further away from the campground, it was exactly the kind of carryout that we would be engaged in.  "

subject had briefly made contact with 911 to report himself as missing
and had given a brief description of his surroundings before his cell
phone died. The subject was found having slid down into a ravine, and
was evacuated with the help of members of several units. He was found
alive and with only minor injuries. BAMRU had two members in the field

Interviewing is an important part of search investigation and yet is often a hastily done and incomplete task. In many searches especially in an urban environment, an interview may be the largest generator of clues on where to search. This presentation/workshop will discuss why we need to interview and compare and contrast interview and interrogation in law enforcement and the unique requirements and needs in the Search and Rescue world. It will probe the ""how to"" mechanics of conducting a good interview from the setting for the interview, to the demeanor of the interviewer, to the type of in depth questions and how the information gathered can be used to paint a mental picture and profile of the missing subject. This information can then be used to assist the planning function in establishing where to look and the best use of SAR resources. The discussions will include initial and post search interviewing, as well as telephone and door-to-door interviewing. The workshop will also include interview practice exercises."

We have performed this presentation for the past 4 years.  By performing this community service, we will be educating kids at the beginning of a week long event.  For many of these kids, it is the first time camping in a wilderness setting.  We equip the kids with some knowledge about how help themselves and us in the event they become lost in the wilderness.  Consider it ""Preventative SAR"".
 
We typically show a 15 minute video, and have a short Q&A about what they learned.  Afterwards, we take the group outside and let the groups perform some little handling exercises where they get a feeling for what it's like to be involved in a rescue and that it's hard work; hopefully it makes it a bit fun, and perhaps they might remember some of the presentation.
 
Members are encouraged to attend and assist with the presentation and supervise the litter handling.  Having members in red shirts or SMCSO uniforms are appreciated.

This trip provides the children an opportunity to experience the great outdoors and enjoy a brief respite from the stress of inner city life.  BAMRU promotes preventative-SAR by presenting the Hug-A-Tree activity; this program was developed by NASAR to educate children in a select few of the most basic and vital survival principles.  

It is also an opportunity to demonstrate some of the tools and techniques to the children and allows kids to meet more personnel who could be involved in the event a search be initiated."
