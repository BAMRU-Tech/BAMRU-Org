      up, ascend the snowfield/glacier and locate a crevasse system where we will
      set-up and run multiple crevasse rescue systems using various snow/ice anchors.  Day
      3 has two tracks: a) practice ice axe self arrest and running belays if not

    description: ! 'The pre-planning exercises are designed to help us gather data
      on a park or open space in regards to terrain, vegetation, hazards, high-probability
      areas, command post logistics, and communications challenges.  As with our previous
      efforts at Sam McDonald Park and Russian Ridge OSP, this exercise will focus
      on using the same protocols that we would use on an actual search:  teams will
      be formed, given assignments, briefed and dispatched.  When those teams return,
      they will be debriefed for information about their assigned area, and GPS tracks
      and waypoints will be downloaded. In addition to the benefits we receive from
      our exposure to the parks, we also meet with the rangers that work these areas
      and develop relationships that will pay dividends when we respond to search
      emergencies.  While I was meeting with the Supervising Ranger for Butano, a
      10 year old girl suffered a fall in the park and suffered a broken arm  radius
      and ulna fractures, with severe angulation.  She was only about a quarter of
      a mile from the campground, and the call was handled by CalFire and AMR with
      the Ranger and myself assisting.  But it was clear that if she had been much
      further away from the campground, it was exactly the kind of carryout that we
      would be engaged in.  '

      Members Only -\n\nInterviewing is an important part of search investigation
      and yet is often a hastily done and incomplete task. In many searches especially
      in an urban environment, an interview may be the largest generator of clues
      on where to search. This presentation/workshop will discuss why we need to interview
      and compare and contrast interview and interrogation in law enforcement and
      the unique requirements and needs in the Search and Rescue world. It will probe
      the \"how to\" mechanics of conducting a good interview from the setting for
      the interview, to the demeanor of the interviewer, to the type of in depth questions
      and how the information gathered can be used to paint a mental picture and profile
      of the missing subject. This information can then be used to assist the planning
      function in establishing where to look and the best use of SAR resources. The
      discussions will include initial and post search interviewing, as well as telephone
      and door-to-door interviewing. The workshop will also include interview practice
      exercises."

      and have a short Q&A about what they learned.  Afterwards, we take the group
      outside and let the groups perform some little handling exercises where they
      get a feeling for what it's like to be involved in a rescue and that it's hard
      work; hopefully it makes it a bit fun, and perhaps they might remember some

      the "how to" mechanics of conducting a good interview from the setting for the

      and how the information gathered can be used to paint a mental picture and profile

      function in establishing where to look and the best use of SAR resources. The
      discussions will include initial and post search interviewing, as well as telephone
      and door-to-door interviewing. The workshop will also include interview practice
